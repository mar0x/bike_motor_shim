# Shimano e-bike motor shim
Shimano e-bike shim between wheel sensor and motor to "extend the limits".

Attiny85 controller reads sensor pulses and adjust frequency to keep assist working.
Shim has relay for by-pass which is activated in absence of power. Most expensive part
is Shimano Di2 wire and Junction required for smooth connection.
